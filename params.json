{"name":"Events","tagline":"Development Repository for Zen Cart Scheduled Events Mod","body":"Greetings,\r\nI have (for some time) wanted to change my Scheduled Events mod to work strictly through the admin area of Zen Cart.\r\nI envision utilizing a similar format to the category_product_listing.php in admin/includes/modules.\r\nThe mod would need to create the database and allow editing, copying, and additions from the category_product_listing.php very similar to the form for creating/editing a product.\r\nI envision all this being under the extras admin toolbar with a heading of Scheduled Events.\r\nOf course, it will need to be registered with the proper configuration areas in order to track its status.\r\nOnce developed, Retail Outlets and Recipes will be soon to follow.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
