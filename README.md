Development Repository for Zen Cart Scheduled Events Mod
The goal is to:
1.  Add an eventz table to the existing Zen Cart Database
2.  Register and initialize the table to Zen Cart Configuration and set "Scheduled Events" in the Extras Menu
3.  Develop the current categrories/products page to be used for creation/deletion/changing of Scheduled Events.
4.  Database and info should follow the basic idea of Scheduled Events version 1.7.0 found in this repository.
